# gallinule

Gallinule is a small React app to browse iOS App Store reviews for popular Australian property apps.

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

This project builds on top of my React experience with [Dipper](https://github.com/donny/dipper). I learn to use Redux for state management and `styled-components` for styling.

### Project

Gallinule retrieves and displays iOS App Store reviews from Apple iTunes site. It has a very simple interface where a user can select an iOS Australian property app and Gallinule shows the user reviews for that particular app. The screenshot of Gallinule:
